\item Divide $p(x)$ by $g(x)$, where $p(x) = x + 3x^2– 1$ and $g(x) = 1 + x$.
\item Divide the polynomial $p(x) = 3x^4-4x^3-3x-1 $ by $x-1$.
\item Find the value of $k$, if $x – 1$ is a factor of $p(x) = 4x^3+ 3x^2 - 4x + k$.

\item Divide $2x^2+3x+1$ by $x+2$.
\item Divide $3x^3+x^2+2x+5$ by $1+2x+x^2$.
\item Find all the zeroes of $2x^4-3x^3-3x^2+6x-2$, if you know that two of its zeroes are $\sqrt{2}$ and $-\sqrt{2}$.
\item John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and the product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find out how many marbles they had to start with.
\item  A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of production of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys produced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was \rupee 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day.
