\item How many positive integers less than 1000 have the property that the sum of the digits of each such number is divisible by 7 and the number itself is divisible by 3?

\item A contractor has two teams of workers. team A and team B. Team A can complete a job in 12 days and team B can do the same job in 36 days. Team A starts working on the job and team B joins team A after four days. The team A withdraws after two more days. For how many more days should team B work to complete the job? 

\item There are eight rooms on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of a hotel, with four rooms on each side of the corridor, symmetrically situated (that is each room is exactly opposite to one other room). Four guests have to be accommodated in four of the eight rooms (that is, one in each) such that no two guests are in adjacent rooms or in opposite rooms. In how many ways can the guests be accommodated?

$f(n \pi + x) = f(x)$ for all real x.

\item In a class, the total numbers of boys and girls are in the ratio $4 : 3$. On one day it was found that 8 boys and 14 girls were absent from the class, and that the number of boys was the square of the number of girls. What is the total number of students in the class?

$n! + 1$ and $(n + 1)!$. For 
$n < 100$, ﬁnd the largest value of $h_{n}$.
