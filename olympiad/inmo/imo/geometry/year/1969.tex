\item Given $n > 4$ points in the plane such that no three are collinear. Prove that there are at least $\begin{pmatrix} 
n-3 \\ 2 
\end{pmatrix}$ convex quadrilaterals whose vertices are four of the given points.
\item A semicircular arc $\gamma$ is drawn on AB as diameter. C is a point on $\gamma$ other than A and B, and D is the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB. We consider three circles, $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$, $\gamma_3$, all tangent to the line AB. Of these, $\gamma_1$ is inscribed in $\triangle{ABC}$, while $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$ are both tangent to CD and to $\gamma$, one on each side of CD. Prove that $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$ have a second tangent in common.
