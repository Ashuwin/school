\item Rain is falling vertically with a speed of 35 $m s^{-1}$
after sometime with a speed of 12 $m s^{-1}$
. Winds starts blowing in
east to west direction. In which direction should a boy waiting at a bus stop hold his umbrella ?

\item A motorboat is racing towards north at 25 km/h and the water current in that region is 10 km/h in the direction of 60$\degree$ east of south. Find the resultant velocity of the boat.
\item Rain is falling vertically with a speed of 35 $m s^{-1}$
. A woman rides a bicycle with a speed of 12 $ms^{-1}$ in east to west
direction. What is the direction in which she should hold her umbrella ?
\item  A hiker stands on the edge of a cliff 490 m above the ground and throws a stone horizontally with an initial speed of 15 $m s^{-1}$
. Neglecting air resistance,
find the time taken by the stone to reach the ground, and the speed with which it hits the ground. (Take g = 9.8 $m s^{-2}$
).
\item  A cricket ball is thrown at a speed of 28 $m s^{-1}$
in a direction 30$\degree$ above
the horizontal. Calculate 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  the maximum height, 
\item  the time taken by the ball to return to the same level, and 
\item  the distance from the thrower to the point where the ball returns to the same level.
\end{enumerate}
