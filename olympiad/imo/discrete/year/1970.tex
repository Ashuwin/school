\item In a plane there are 100 points, no three of which are collinear. Consider all
possible triangles having these points as vertices. Prove that no more than 70$\%$ of these triangles are acute-angled.\\
\item Find the set of all positive integers n with the property that the set [n, n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, n + 4, n + 5] can be partitioned into two sets such that the product of the numbers in one set equals the product of the numbers in the other set.
