\item Let $x_i, y_i$ (i = 1, 2,....., n) be real numbers such that
\begin{align*}
x_1 \geq x_2 \geq...... \geq x_n  \text{ and } y_1 \geq y_2 \geq...... \geq y_n.
\end{align*}
Prove that, if $z_1, z_2,...... , z_n$ is any permutation of $y_1, y_2,..... , y_n,$ then\\
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - z_i)^2$
\item Let $a_1, a_2, a_3,.......$ be an infinite increasing sequence of positive integers. Prove that for every p $\geq$ 1 there are infinitely many $a_m$ which can be written in the form $a_m = xa_p + ya_q$ with x, y positive integers and $q > p.$
\item When $4444^{4444}$ is written in decimal notation, the sum of its digits is A. Let
B be the sum of the digits of A. Find the sum of the digits of B. (A and B are written in decimal notation.)
