\item Prove that from a set of ten distinct two-digit numbers (in the decimal system), it is possible to select two disjoint subsets whose members have the same sum.\\
\item Let m and n be arbitrary non-negative integers. Prove that\\
\\ $\frac{(2m!)(2n!)}{m!n!(m+n)!}$\\
\\ is an integer$(0! = 1)$\\
\item Let f and g be real-valued functions defined for all real values of x and y, and satisfying the equation
\begin{align}
f(x + y) + f(x - y) = 2f(x)g(y)
\end{align}
\\for all x, y. Prove that if f(x) is not identically zero, and if $\begin{vmatrix} f(x) \end{vmatrix} \leq 1$ for all x, then $\begin{vmatrix} g(y) \end{vmatrix} \leq 1$ for all y.
