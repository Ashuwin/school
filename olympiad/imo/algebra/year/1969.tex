\item Prove that for all real numbers $x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2, z_1, z_2,$ with $x_1 > 0, x_2 > 0, x_1y_1-z_{1}^{2}> 0, x_2y_2 - z_{2}^{2} > 0,$ the inequality\\
\\$\frac{8}{(x_1 + x_2)(y_1 + y_2) - (z_1 + z_2)^{2}} \leq \frac{1}{x_1y_1 - z_{1}^{2}} + \frac{1}{x_2y_2 - z_{2}^{2}}$\\
\\is satisfied. Give necessary and sufficient conditions for equality.\\

\item Prove that there are infinitely many natural numbers a with the following property: the number $z = n^{4} + a$ is not prime for any natural number n.
