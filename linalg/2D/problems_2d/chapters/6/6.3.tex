The following problems refer to the ellipse whose 
equation is
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\end{align*}
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Show that the eccentric angle of one end of a latus rectum is $\cos^{-1}e$.
\item If $\alpha$ is the eccentric angle of a point $P$ on an ellipse, what are the coordinates of the
corresponding point $Q$ on the auxilary circle?
Write down the equations of the tangents at $P$ and $Q$ and show that they intersect on the major axis.
\item Prove that, if $CP$, $CD$ are conjugate radii of an ellipse and $\omega$ the angle between them, then
$\sin^{2}\omega$ varies as $CP^{-2}+CD^{-2}$.
\item Prove that if a parallelogram is inscribed in an ellipse, its sides are parallel to 
the conjugate diameters.
\item Prove that if $QQ_1$ is a chord of an ellipse parallel to the tangent at $P$ the eccentric angles
of $Q$ and $Q_1$ differ from the eccentric angle at $P$ by equal amounts.
\item Prove that the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the chord joining the points $Q$, $Q_1$ whose
eccentric angles are $\alpha+\beta$, $\alpha-\beta$ is 
\begin{align*}
ax\sec\alpha -by\text{ cosec } \alpha = \brak{a^2-b^2}\cos\beta
\end{align*}
and deduce the equation of the normal at the point whose eccentric angle is $\alpha$.
\item Prove that, if the same chord passes through a focus, then
\begin{align*}
\cos\beta = \pm e \cos\alpha
\end{align*}
\item Prove that the equation of a focal chord parallel to the tangent at the point whose
eccentric angle is $\alpha$ is
\begin{align*}
\frac{x}{a}\cos\alpha + \frac{y}{b}\sin\alpha = \pm e \cos\alpha
\end{align*}
\item Prove that, if $\alpha$ is variable and $\beta$ constant, the chord joining the points whose eccentric angles are $\alpha+\beta$
and $\alpha-\beta$ touches the
ellipse
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = \cos^2\beta
\end{align*}
and that the locus of the poles of the chord is
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = \sec^2\beta
\end{align*}
\item Prove that the tangents at the points whose eccentric angles are $\alpha$, $\alpha+\frac{\pi}{2}$ intersect on the ellipse
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 2
\end{align*}
\item Prove that, if $P$, $Q$ are corresponding points on an ellipse and its auxiliary circle and the normals
at $P$, $Q$ intersect in $R$, then
\begin{align*}
CR = a+b
\end{align*}
\item Prove that, if the line joining the ends of two equal conjugate radii of an ellipse passes through
a focus the eccentricity is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$.
\item Prove that the chords that join the ends of conjugate radii all touch the ellipse
\begin{align*}
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}
