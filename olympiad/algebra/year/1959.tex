\item For what real values of x is
\begin{align}
\sqrt{(x+\sqrt{2x-1}} + \sqrt{(x-\sqrt{2x-1}} = A
\end{align}
given 
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $A =\sqrt{2}$, 
\item  $A = 1$, 
\item  $A = 2$
\end{enumerate}
where only non-negative real numbers are admitted for square roots?
%
\item Let $a, b, c$ be real numbers. Consider the quadratic equation in $\cos x$ :
\begin{align}
a \cos^{2} x + b \cos x + c = 0.
\end{align}
%
Using the numbers $a, b, c$, form a quadratic equation in $\cos 2x$, whose roots are the same as those of the original equation. Compare the equations in $\cos x$ and $\cos 2x$ for $a = 4, b = 2, c = -1$.
