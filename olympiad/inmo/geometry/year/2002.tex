\item For a convex hexagon ABCDEF in which each pair of opposite sides is unequal, consider the following statements:
\\$(a_1)$ AB is parallel DE    $(a_2)$ AE = BD\\
$(a_1)$ BC is parallel EF      $(a_2)$ BF = CE\\
$(a_1)$ CD is parallel FA      $(a_2)$ CA = DF
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that if the all the six statements are true, then the hexagon is cyclic.
\item Prove that in fact, any five of these six statements also imply that the hexagon is cyclic. 
\end{enumerate}
