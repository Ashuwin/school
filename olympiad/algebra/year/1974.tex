\item Determine all possible values of\\
\\ S = $\frac{a}{a+b+d} + \frac{b}{a+b+c} + \frac{c}{b+c+d} + \frac{d}{a+c+d}$\\
\\where a, b, c, d are arbitrary positive numbers.\\

\item Let P be a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients. If n(P) is the number of distinct integers k such that $(P(k))^2$ = 1, prove that n(P) - deg(P) $\leq$ 2, where deg(P) denotes the degree of the polynomial P.
