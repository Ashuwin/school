\item A soldier needs to check on the presence of mines in a region having the shape of an equilateral triangle. The radius of action of his detector is equal to half the altitude of the triangle. The soldier leaves from one vertex of the triangle. What path should he follow in order to travel the least possible distance and still accomplish his mission?\\

\item G is a set of non-constant functions of the real variable x of the form f(x) = ax + b, a and b are real numbers, and G has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If f and g are in G, then $g \circ f$ is in G; here $(g \circ f)$(x) = g[f(x)].
\item If f is in G, then its inverse $f^{-1}$ is in G; here the inverse of f(x) = ax +b
is $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{(x-b)}{a}.$
\item For every f in G, there exists a real number $x_f$ such that $f(x_f) = x_f.$
Prove that there exists a real number k such that f(k) = k for all f in G.
\end{enumerate}
