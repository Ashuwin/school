\item Determine, with proof, the largest number which is the product of positive integers whose sum is 1976.
\item A sequence $[u_n]$ is defined by $u_0$ = 2, $u_1 = \frac{5}{2}$, $u_{n+1} = u_n(u_{n-1}^2 - 2) - u_1$for n = 1,2,.....\\
Prove that for positive integers n, $[u_n] = 2^\frac{[2^{n}-(-1)^{n}]}{3}$
where [x] denotes the greatest integer $\leq$ x.
