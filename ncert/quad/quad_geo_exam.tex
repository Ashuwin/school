\item Sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is 360$\degree$. 
\\
\solution Draw the diagonal and use the fact that sum of the angles of a triangle is 180$\degree$.
\item  A diagonal of a parallelogram divides it into two congruent triangles. 
\\
\solution The alternate angles for the parallel sides are equal.  The diagonal is common.  Use ASA congruence.
%
\item  In a parallelogram, 
\begin{enumerate}
\item opposite sides are equal 
\item  opposite angles are equal
\item  diagonals bisect each other
\end{enumerate}
%
\solution Since the diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles, all the above results follow.
%
\item  A quadrilateral is a parallelogram, if 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item opposite sides are equal or 
\item  opposite angles are equal or 
\item  diagonals bisect each other or 
\item a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel
\end{enumerate}
%
\solution All the above lead to a quadrilateral that has two parallel sides, by showing that the alternate angles are equal.
%
%
\item A rectangle is a parallelogram with one angle that is 90$\degree$.  Show that all angles of the rectangle are 90$\degree$.
%
\\
\solution Draw a diagonal.  Since the diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent triangles, the angle opposite to the right angle is also 90$\degree$. Using congruence, it can be shown that the other two angles are equal.  Now use the fact that the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is 360$\degree$.
%
\item  Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal and vice-versa.

\label{prob:quad_similar}
%
\\
\solution If $DE$ is the lie joining he mid points of $\triangle ABC$,  use cosine formula to find the lengths of $DE$ and $BC$. Then use cosine formula to show that all angles of $\triangle ADE$ are equal to the corresponding angles of $\triangle ABC$.
%
\item  A line through the mid-point of a side of a triangle parallel to another side bisects the third side.
\\
\solution Use cosine formula.
%
\item  The quadrilateral formed by joining the mid-points of the sides of a quadrilateral, in order, is a parallelogram.
%
\\
\solution Draw one diagonal and use Problem \eqref{prob:quad_similar}.  Repeat for the other diagonal to show that the sides are parallel.
%
\item Two parallel lines l and m are intersected by a transversal p. Show that the quadrilateral formed by the bisectors of interior angles is a rectangle.
%
\item Show that the bisectors of angles of a parallelogram form a rectangle.
%
\item A quadrilateral is a parallelogram if a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel.
%
\item $ABCD$ is a parallelogram in which $P$ and $Q$ are mid-points of opposite sides $AB$ and $CD$. If $AQ$ intersects $DP$ at $S$ and $BQ$ intersects $CP$ at $R$, show that: 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $APCQ$ is a parallelogram. 
\item $DPBQ$ is a parallelogram. 
\item $PSQR$ is a parallelogram.
\end{enumerate}
%
\item In $\triangle ABC, D, E$ and $F$ are respectively the mid-points of sides $AB, BC$ and $CA $. Show that $\triangle ABC$ is divided into four congruent triangles by joining $D, E$ and $F$.
\item $l, m$ and $n$ are three parallel lines intersected by transversals $p$ and $q$ such that $l, m$ and $n$ cut off equal intercepts $AB$ and $BC$ on $p$ . Show that $l, m$ and $n$ cut off equal intercepts $DE$ and $EF$ on $q$ also.
%

\item Show that the points $\vec{A} = \myvec{1\\7}, \vec{B} = \myvec{4\\2}, \vec{C}=\myvec{-1\\-1},\vec{D}= \myvec{-4\\4} $  are the vertices of a square.
\\
\solution By inspection, 
%
\begin{align}
\frac{\vec{A}+\vec{C}}{2}=\frac{\vec{B}+\vec{D}}{2} = \myvec{0\\3}
\end{align}
%
Hence, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ bisect each other.
%
Also, 
\begin{align}
\brak{\vec{A}-\vec{C}}^T
\brak{\vec{B}-\vec{D}} = 0
\end{align}
%
$\implies AC \perp BD $.  Hence $ABCD$ is a square.
\item If the points
$
\vec{A} = \myvec{6\\1}, 
\vec{B} = \myvec{8\\2}, 
\vec{C} = \myvec{9\\4}, 
\vec{D} = \myvec{p\\3}
$
are the vertices of a parallelogram, taken in order, find the value of $p$.
\\
\solution In the parallelogram $ABCD$, $AC$ and $BD$ bisect each other.  This can be used to find $p$.
\item If $\vec{A} = \myvec{-5\\7}, \vec{B} = \myvec{-4\\-5}, \vec{C} = \myvec{-1\\-6}, \vec{D} = \myvec{4\\5}$, find the area of the quadrilateral $ABCD$.
%
\\
\solution The area of  $ABCD$ is the sum of the areas of trianges ABD and CBD and is given by 
\begin{multline}
\frac{1}{2}\norm{\brak{\vec{A}-\vec{B}}\times \brak{\vec{A}-\vec{D}}}
\\
+
\frac{1}{2}\norm{\brak{\vec{C}-\vec{B}}\times \brak{\vec{C}-\vec{D}}}
\end{multline}
\item Show that the points 
$\vec{A} = \myvec{1\\2\\3},
 \vec{B} = \myvec{-1\\-2\\-1},
\vec{C} = \myvec{2\\3\\2},
\vec{D} = \myvec{4\\7\\6}.
$
are the vertices of a parallelogram $ABCD$ but it is not a rectangle.
%
\\
\solution Since the direction vectors
%
\begin{align}
\vec{A}-\vec{B}&= \vec{D}-\vec{C}
\\
\vec{A}-\vec{D}&= \vec{B}-\vec{C}
\end{align}
%
$AB \parallel CD$ and $AD \parallel BC$.  Hence $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.  However, 
%
\begin{align}
\brak{\vec{A}-\vec{B}}^T\brak{ \vec{A}-\vec{D}}\ne 0
\end{align}
%
Hence, it is not a rectangle.

\frac{1}{2}\norm{\myvec{3\\1\\4} \times \myvec{1\\-1\\1}}

\item Kamla has a triangular field with sides 240 m, 200 m, 360 m, where she grew wheat. In another triangular field with sides 240 m, 320 m, 400 m adjacent to the previous field, she wanted to grow potatoes and onions. She divided the field in two parts by joining the mid-point of the longest side to the opposite vertex and grew patatoes in one part and onions in the other part. Draw the figure for this problem.  How much area (in hectares) has been used for wheat, potatoes and onions? (1 hectare = 10000 $m^2$).
\item Students of a school staged a rally for cleanliness campaign. They walked through the lanes in two groups. One group walked through the lanes AB, BC and CA; while the other through AC, CD and DA. Then they cleaned the area enclosed within their lanes. If AB = 9 m, BC = 40 m, CD = 15 m, DA = 28 m and $\angle B = 90\degree$, which group cleaned more area and by how much? Draw the corresponding figure.  Find the total area cleaned by the students (neglecting the width of the lanes).

\item Sanya has a piece of land which is in the shape of a rhombus. She wants her one daughter and one son to work on the land and produce different crops. She divided the land in two equal parts. If the perimeter of the land is 400 m and one of the diagonals is 160 m, how much area each of them will get for their crops? Draw the rhombus.
