\item Prove that the set of integers of the form $2^k - 3$\\
(k = 2, 3,....) contains an infinite subset in which every two members are relatively prime.\\
\item Let A = $(a_{ij})$(i, j = 1, 2,....., n) be a square matrix whose elements are non negative integers. Suppose that whenever an element $a_{ij}$ = 0, the sum of the
elements in the $i^{th}$ row and the $j^{th}$ column is $\geq$ n. Prove that the sum of
all the elements of the matrix is $\geq \frac{n^2}{2}$
