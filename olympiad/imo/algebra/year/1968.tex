\item Find all natural numbers x such that the product of their digits (in decimal
notation) is equal to $x^{2} - 10x - 22.$\\

\item Consider the system of equations\\
\\$ax_{1}^{2} + bx_1 + c = x_2$\\
\\$ax_{2}^{2} + bx_2 + c = x_3$\\
\\.......\\
\\$ax_{n-1}^{2} + bx_{n-1} + c = x_{n}$\\
\\$ax_{n}^{2} + bx_{n} + c = x_{1}$\\
\\with unknowns $x_1, x_2,......, x_n$, where a, b, c are real and a$\neq$0. Let $\Delta = (b - 1)^2 - 4ac.$ Prove that for this system\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $\Delta < 0,$ there is no solution,
\item if $\Delta = 0,$ there is exactly one solution,
\item if $\Delta > 0,$ there is more than one solution.
\end{enumerate}
