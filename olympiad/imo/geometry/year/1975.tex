\item Determine, with proof, whether or not one can find 1975 points on the circumference of a circle with unit radius such that the distance between any two of them is a rational number.
\item On the sides of an arbitrary triangle ABC, triangles ABR, BCP, CAQ are constructed externally with $\angle{CBP}=\angle{CAQ}=45^{o},\angle{BCP}=\angle{ACQ}=30^{o},\angle{ABR}=\angle{BAR}=15^{o}.$Prove that $\angle{QRP}=90^{o}$ and QR = RP.
