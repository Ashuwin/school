here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.27 	 x_
         1 + x_2 \leq 2 \nonumber\\
I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

! Undefined control sequence.
<recently read> \text 
                      
l.30 	 \text
            { where } x_1,x_2 &\geq 0 \nonumber
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Misplaced alignment tab character &.
l.30 	 \text{ where } x_1,x_2 &
                               \geq 0 \nonumber
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
