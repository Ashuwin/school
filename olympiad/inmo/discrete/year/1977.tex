\item In a finite sequence of real numbers the sum of any seven successive terms is
negative, and the sum of any eleven successive terms is positive. Determine
the maximum number of terms in the sequence.
\item Let n be a given integer $>$ 2, and let $V_n$ be the set of integers 1 + kn, where
k = 1, 2,..... A number m $\in V_n$ is called indecomposable in $V_n$ if there do not exist numbers p, q $\in V_n$ such that pq = m. Prove that there exists a number r $\in V_n$ that can be expressed as the product of elements indecomposable in $V_n$ in more than one way. (Products which differ only in the order of their factors will be considered the same.)\\

\item Let f(n) be a function defined on the set of all positive integers and having all its values in the same set. Prove that if
\begin{align*}
f(n + 1) > f(f(n))
\end{align*}
for each positive integer n, then\\
f(n) = n for each n.
