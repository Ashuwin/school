\item Let ABCD be a parallelogram with side lengths AB = a, AD = 1, and with $\angle{BAD} =\alpha$. If $\triangle{ABD}$ is acute, prove that the four circles of radius 1 with centers A, B, C, D cover the parallelogram if and only if
\begin{align*}
a \geq\cos{\alpha} + \sqrt{3} \sin{\alpha}.
\end{align*}
\item Prove that if one and only one edge of a tetrahedron is greater than 1, then its volume is $\leq \frac{1}{8}.$
\item Let $A_0B_0C_0$ and $A_1B_1C_1$ be any two acute-angled triangles. Consider all triangles ABC that are similar to $\triangle{A_1B_1C_1}$ (so that vertices $A_1, B_1, C_1$ correspond to vertices A, B, C, respectively) and circumscribed about triangle $A_0B_0C_0$ (where $A_0$ lies on BC, $B_0$ on CA, and A$C_0$ on AB). Of all such possible triangles, determine the one with maximum area, and construct it.
