\item Consider a convex polyhedron $P_1$ with nine vertices $A_1A_2,......, A_9;$ let $P_i$ be the polyhedron obtained from $P_1$ by a translation that moves vertex $A_1$ to $A_i$(i = 2, 3,......, 9). Prove that at least two of the polyhedra $P_1, P_2,...., P_9$ have an interior point in common.
\item All the faces of tetrahedron ABCD are acute-angled triangles. We consider all closed polygonal paths of the form XY ZTX defined as follows: X is a point on edge AB distinct from A and B; similarly, Y, Z, T are interior points of edges BCCD, DA, respectively. Prove:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\angle{DAB}+ \angle{BCD} \neq \angle{CDA} + \angle{ABC},$ then among the polygonal paths, there is none of minimal length.
\item If $\angle{DAB}+ \angle{BCD}= \angle{CDA}+ \angle{ABC},$ then there are infinitely many
shortest polygonal paths, their common length being 2AC $\sin{\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ where
$\alpha = \angle{BAC}+\angle{CAD}+\angle{DAB}.$
\end{enumerate}
