\item Consider the sequence $[c_n]$, where
\begin{align*}
c_1 = a_1 + a_2 +..... + a_8\\
c_2 = a_{1}^{2} + a_{2}^{2} +.....+ a_{8}^{2}\\
.....\\c_2 = a_{1}^{n} + a_{2}^{n} +.....+ a_{8}^{n}
\end{align*}
in which $a_1, a_2,......., a_8$ are real numbers not all equal to zero. Suppose that an infinite number of terms of the sequence $[c_n]$ are equal to zero. Find all natural numbers n for which $c_n$ = 0.\\
\item Let k, m, n be natural numbers such that m + k + 1 is a prime greater than
n + 1. Let $c_s$ = s(s + 1). Prove that the product
\begin{align*}
(c_{m+1} - c_{k})(c_{m+2} -  c_{k})..... (c_{m+n} - c_{k})
\end{align*}
is divisible by the product $c_1c_2.....c_n.$
