\item Consider the system of p equations in q = 2p unknowns $x_1, x_2,......., x_q :$\\
\\$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 +......+ a_{1q}x_q = 0$\\
\\$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 +......+ a_{2q}x_q = 0$\\
\\.......\\
\\$a_{p1}x_1 + a_{p2}x_2 +......+ a_{pq}x_q = 0$\\
\\with every coefficient $a_{ij}$ member of the set [-1,0,1]. Prove that the system
has a solution $(x_1, x_2,......, x_q)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item all $x_j$ (j = 1,2, ..., q) are integers,
\item there is at least one value of j for which $x_j \neq$ 0,
\item $\begin{vmatrix} x_j \end{vmatrix} \leq$q(j = 1,2, ..., q).
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $P_1(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $P_j(x) = P_1(P_{j-1}(x))$ for j = 2,3, · · ·. Show that, for any positive integer n, the roots of the equation $P_n(x)$ = x are real and
distinct.
