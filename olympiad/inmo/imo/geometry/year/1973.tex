\item Point O lies on the line g:$\overrightarrow{OP_1}, \overrightarrow{OP_2}..........\overrightarrow{OP_n}$ are unit vectors such that points
$P_1, P_2,......, P_n$ all lie in a plane containing g and on one side of g. Prove that
if n is odd,
$\begin{vmatrix}
\overrightarrow{OP_1} + \overrightarrow{OP_2}.....+\overrightarrow{OP_n} 
\end{vmatrix}$
Here 
$\begin{vmatrix} 
\overrightarrow{OM}
\end{vmatrix}$
denotes the length of vector $\overrightarrow{OM}.$
\item Determine whether or not there exists a finite set M of points in space not lying in the same plane such that, for any two points A and B of M, one can select two other points C and D of M so that lines AB and CD are parallel and not coincident.
