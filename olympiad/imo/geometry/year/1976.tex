\item In a plane convex quadrilateral of area 32, the sum of the lengths of two opposite sides and one diagonal is 16. Determine all possible lengths of the other diagonal.
\item A rectangular box can be filled completely with unit cubes. If one places as many cubes as possible, each with volume 2, in the box, so that their edges are parallel to the edges of the box, one can fill exactly 40$\%$ of the box. Determine the possible dimensions of all such boxes.
