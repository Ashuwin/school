\item Find all polynomials P, in two variables, with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  for a positive integer n and all real t, x, y\\
P(tx, ty) = $t^n$P(x, y)\\
(that is, P is homogeneous of degree n),
\item  for all real a, b, c, 
\\P(b + c, a) + P(c + a, b) + P(a + b, c) = 0,
\item  P(1,0) = 1.
\end{enumerate}
