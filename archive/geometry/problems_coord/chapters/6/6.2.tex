\item Find the pole of the line $3x+4y = 5$ with regard to the ellipse
\begin{align*}
3x^2+4y^2=5
\end{align*}
\item Find the poles of the lines $2x-y=1$ and $x+3y=4$ with regard to the ellipse $x^2+4y^2=6$, and verify that the line joining
the poles is the polar of the point of intersection of the lines.
\item Prove that the points $\brak{4,1}$, $\brak{1,-1}$ are conjugate with regard to the ellipse

\item Find the equatioin of a line through the point $\brak{3,2}$ and conjugate to the
line $x+y=1$ with regard to the ellipse
\begin{align*}
3x^2+4y^2 = 2

\item Prove that, if the polar of a point is at right angles to the line joining the point  to
the centre of an ellipse, the point must lie on one of the axes.
\item Prove that, if $\brak{x_2,y_2}$ is the pole of the normal at $\brak{x_1,y_1}$, then
\begin{align*}
\frac{x_1x_2}{a^4}=-\frac{y_1y_2}{b^4}  = \frac{1}{a^2+b^2}
