\item Prove that for every natural number m, there exists a finite set S of points in a plane with the following property: For every point A in S, there are exactly m points in S which are at unit distance from A.\\

\item Prove that the following assertion is true for n = 3 and n = 5, and that it is false for every other natural number $n > 2$ :
If $a_1, a_2,....., a_n$ are arbitrary real numbers, then $(a_1 - a_2)(a_1 - a_3)..... (a_1 - a_n) + (a_2 - a_1)(a_2 - a_3)...... (a_2 - a_n) +.......+ (a_n - a_1)(a_n - a_2)....... (a_n - a_{n-1} \geq 0$
