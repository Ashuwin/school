\item Sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is 360$\degree$. 
\item  In a parallelogram, 
\label{them:pgm_basic}
\begin{enumerate}
\item opposite sides are equal 
\item  opposite angles are equal
\item  diagonals bisect each other
\end{enumerate}
\solution $\because AD \parallel BC, AB \parallel CD$, alternate angles are equal.  Hence, 
%
\begin{align}
\triangle ADB &\cong \triangle  DBC \quad (ASA)
\\
\because \angle ADB &= \angle DBC
\\
\angle ABD &= \angle BDC
\\
DB \text{ common}
\end{align}
%
So $AB = CD$ and $\angle A = \angle C$.  Similarly, it can be shown that $AD = BC$ and $\angle B = \angle D$
Also, 
%
\begin{align}
\triangle OAD &\cong \triangle  OBC \quad (ASA)
\\
\because AD = BC
\end{align}
%
Hence $OD = OB, OA=OC$
\item Construct parallelogram $ABCD$ 	in Fig. \ref{fig:pgm_sss}	
given that  $BC = 5, AB = 6, \angle C = 85 \degree$.
\\
\solution $BD$ is found using the cosine formula and $\triangle BDC$ is drawn with 
%
\begin{align}
\vec{B} = \myvec{0\\0},
\vec{C} = \myvec{5\\0},
\end{align}
%
Since the diagonals bisect each other, 
%
\begin{align}
\vec{O} &= \frac{\vec{B}+\vec{D}}{2}
\\
\vec{A} &= 2\vec{O} - \vec{C}.
\end{align}
%
$AB$ and $AD$ are then joined to complete the $\parallel$gm.

%
\item A quadrilateral is a parallelogram if a pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel.
%
\item Parallelograms on the same base (or equal bases) and between the same parallels are equal in area.
\item Area of a parallelogram is the product of its base and the corresponding altitude. 
\item Parallelograms on the same base (or equal bases) and having equal areas lie between the same parallels.
\item If a parallelogram and a triangle are on the same base and between the same parallels, then area of the triangle is half the area of the parallelogram.
