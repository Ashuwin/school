\item Let M be a point on the side AB of $\triangle{ABC}.$ Let $r_1,r_2$ and r be the radii of the inscribed circles of triangles AMC, BMC and ABC. Let $q_1, q_2$ and q be the radii of the inscribed circles of the same triangles that lie in the angle ACB. Prove that
\begin{align*}
\frac{r_1}{q_1}.\frac{r_2}{q_2} = \frac{r}{q}
\end{align*}
\item In the tetrahedron ABCD, angle BDC is a right angle. Suppose that the foot H of the perpendicular from D to the plane ABC is the intersection of the altitudes of $\triangle{ABC}.$Prove that
\begin{align*}
(AB + BC + CA)^2 \leq 6(AD^2 + BD^2 + CD^2).
\end{align*}
For what tetrahedra does equality hold?
